E-Cell Round-1 Assignment:

I am P Abhishek Kumar, CSE Branch Student, NITK. I have designed a portfolio website as the task given for round-1 recuritment by E-Cell Team, NITK. I have implemented the design using basic HTML, CSS and a bit of JS. I have not used any framework since it was my first website designed specifically. I would have used bootstrap for the design but I have gone with the basic programming. The website is responsive for Desktop, Tablet and Mobiles. The task of making it responsive took maximum time since it needs to be verified for number of devices. I have used JS only in the feedback sending part through e-mail. I have used transitions and hovering effects to make it bit attractive.
Later I will be going to try it with frameworks too. This is a brief of my portfolio website design.

Thanking You.
